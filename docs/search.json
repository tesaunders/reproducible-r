It’s a good idea to create a folder called something like ‘projects’ in your user folder and select this every time, to group your repositories together in the same place on your machine(s). Let’s do that by clicking ‘Browse’, navigating to your user folder, and creating a new folder called ‘projects’ before selecting it and clicking ‘create project’.\nRStudio opens a new project called r-data-science. RStudio projects are essentially the .RProj file - this file tells RStudio that this folder is home to the project, and to use the folder as the ‘working directory’, or the place where R is looking when you ask it to load data or save an output."

This presents an opportunity to empower researchers to apply software development principles to the code they write to ensure their work has maximum impact. We will cover the following concepts in this workshop:\n\nOrganising work in projects\nWriting readable and modular R code\nCollaborating with version control\nManaging package dependencies\nPublishing software projects\n\nEach of these topics alone could easily fill a 1.5 hour workshop, so our treatment of them will necessarily be brief. But our main aim here is to introduce these concepts, show how they are used together, and walk through how to start applying them to your research projects."

Install R packages\nOpen RStudio and install the following R packages by:\n\nSelecting Tools &gt; Install Packages &gt; and entering readr, readxl, dplyr, ggplot2, renv and select ‘Install’.\n\nOR\n\nRunning the following command in the console:\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"readr\", \"readxl\", \"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\", \"renv\"))\n\n\n4.
